TOOL - ODROID UTILITY
=====================

I've started to write this script to replace kernel-update.

It does WAY more then the current kernel-update is doing.

I plan to replace kernel-update with this tool very soon.

**Sources:** https://github.com/mdrjr/odroid-utility

**How to Install :**

```
sudo -s

wget -O /usr/local/bin/odroid-utility.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdrjr/odroid-utility/master/odroid-utility.sh

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/odroid-utility.sh

odroid-utility.sh
```


Don't worry about the extra files. The script self-updates itself everytime its started.

**What is supported**

Debian and Ubuntu ATM. More to come,

Xorg on/off,

Change hostname,

Configure HDMI (x/x2/u2/u3) only,

Kernel Update (all boards),

boot.scr's update (all boards) Oh yes. Updating the kernel doesn't replace your boot.scr's anymore. If you was using custom ones to boot from hdd then they should be safe now,

Rebuilds ARMSOC DDX , installs new Mali drivers when they are available and fixes ABI errors,

Filesystem resize.

**TODO :**

HDMI Configuration for XU,

XBMC Install/Update,

Support for other OS.

Ideas and patchs are welcome. Either post a diff with your e-mail and name or submit a PR on github.
